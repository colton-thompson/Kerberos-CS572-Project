Here is the list of files in this directory:

packet_header.h     -- defines the format of the packets. It should not be changed. 
aes_func.c          -- implements encryption and decryption function of AES_CBC.
                       It should not be changed. 
enc_dec_example.c   -- shows how to use the encryption and decryption functions of AES.
client.c            -- A client program that gets credential from the authentication server and then
                            connects to the server. Before it communicates with the server, it must
                            first authenticate itself.
server.c            -- A server program that receives input and validates users before sending messages
authserver.c        -- A server program that authenticates the client

To compile:  
make
Note: If there is any compile-time error, you may need to install openssl first: (on Ubuntu VM)
sudo apt-get install libssl-dev


To run:
    - First run the two servers with the following input
        - server:       ./server <server port> <serverkey>
        - authsever:    ./authserver <authserverport> <clientID> <clientkey> <serverID> <serverkey>
    - Then run the clien with the following input
        - client:       ./client <authservername> <authserverport> <clientkey> <server name> <server port> <clientID> <serverID>


To run the client and the servers on the same machine:
    - Open 3 separate terminals
    - Use the commands from above to execute 
    - Note, order is important as the servers need to be running before the client

Note, I collaborated with my peers Lauren Bassett and Brian Bruns. We all had our own troubles initially, but by collaborating we were 
    able to work through common problems and help each other better understand aspects of the project.
